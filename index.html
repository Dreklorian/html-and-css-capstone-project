    <h1>Cool Stuff</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Cool Stuff, a silly little website built solely to satisfy a class assignment. There is really no point to it at all; well, maybe to practice HTML and CSS. Take a look around if you like, but whether or not you find the stuff here to be cool is a matter of taste. There is not even a guarantee that I (the author) find it cool.</p>
    <h2>Sections</h2>
    <p>You are on the Home page. Three more pages are linked above. Woe to them that try to use the Contact page, as it does nothing and goes nowhere. Five possibly interesting links exist on the Links page, but don't get your hopes up. Finally, the pictures page has six images borrowed from other online places; click on them to go to said places.</p>
    <h2>A Cool Quote</h2>
    <p>“Intelligence and will have alternatively exercised their power in the world; religion and philosophy still battle in our times and must finally end up in agreement. Christianity's initial goal was to establish, through obedience and faith, a supernatural or religious equality between men and to immobilize intelligence with faith so as to provide a point of support for virtue, which had just destroyed the aristocracy of science, or rather replaced that aristocracy, which had already been destroyed. Philosophy, on the contrary, worked to bring men back through liberty and reason to natural inequality, and to substitute, by founding the reign of industry, virtue with practical knowledge. Neither of these two actions was complete and sufficient, neither of them brought men to perfection and happiness. What we dream of today, almost without daring to hope for it, is an alliance between these two forces regarded for so long as opposites, and this alliance we have reason to desire: for the two great powers of the human soul are no more opposed to one another than the male sex is opposed to the female sex; without a doubt they are different, but their apparently contrary dispositions only come from their natural tendency to meet and unite.” - Eliphas Levi, The Doctrine of High Magic, 1854.</p>
